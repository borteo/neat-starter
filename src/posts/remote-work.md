Remote working is a _rapidly growing trend_ in the modern workforce, offering numerous benefits such as improved organizational commitment, higher job satisfaction, enhanced performance, and reduced stress and burnout.

Like many others, I find this trend to be simply awesome! It’s an incredible opportunity for us — programmers from across the globe — to collaborate on exciting and challenging projects with talented and inspiring individuals.

## Working from Home – or anywhere

Unlike the traditional office setup, remote work frees us from being tied to a single physical location. We can work from home or anywhere with a reliable Internet connection — away from the distractions of the office or the hassle of commuting. Whether in our hometowns or exotic destinations, the choice is ours.

Since joining [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) in 2015, I’ve traveled and lived in six countries across two continents. I’ve taken road trips in Italy, married my amazing wife in Brazil, and caught up with friends in the Netherlands and the UK. I love the flexibility it provides.

## Making It Work

You may have experienced companies that allow remote work, or perhaps you’ve worked with small teams where most members are remote. While remote collaboration seems manageable for smaller groups, imagine coordinating with dozens or even hundreds of people remotely.

At InVision, we firmly believe it’s possible — and we do it every day! As a fully distributed company with team members spread across 14 countries, we’ve embraced this model wholeheartedly.

Research backs us up: remote workers often report fewer distractions and greater productivity ([CTrip WFH Experiment - Stanford University](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18871)). That said, working remotely is not without its challenges.

Here are some strategies and tools we’ve adopted to make remote work effective:

- Communication
- Small, connected teams
- Bridging the gap between virtual and physical environments
- Recognition — every little bit counts

## Communication

Communication is both the biggest challenge and the cornerstone of building trust within remote teams.

As [Avi Posluns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aviposluns/), our Director of Employee Happiness, puts it:

> When working remote, there is almost no such thing as over-communication. In an office environment, we pick up so much from body language, desk photos, or even how someone dresses. Remote work removes these non-verbal cues, requiring much more written and verbal communication. When in doubt, communicate more rather than less.

We use Slack as our virtual office, treating its channels like physical rooms. Even with numerous channels, we join only the relevant ones, keeping communication effective and manageable. This way, conversations flow quickly without becoming overwhelming.

## Small, Connected Teams

We’ve found that keeping teams _small and focused_ makes them more agile and efficient.

At InVision, teams work on distinct projects, functioning like mini start-ups. For instance, I’m part of the Red Team, which includes four engineers (one focused on QA), an engineering manager, a product manager, and a designer.

This structure minimizes communication overhead and ensures each team operates as a self-contained unit. If collaboration with another team is needed, we simply hop into their Slack channel and connect. This approach fosters a culture of _synergy_ and efficient teamwork.

## Bridging Virtual and Physical Spaces

To stay connected, our teams hold daily stand-ups via Google Hangouts. Additionally, we share progress through “demo bits” — short video updates posted on Slack every Friday. These demos highlight achievements and invite feedback.

As an engineer, I rely heavily on whiteboarding for problem-solving. To replicate this remotely, we use Liveshare, a virtual whiteboard where team members can collaborate visually. It’s an invaluable tool for dissecting complex ideas.

## Recognition – Every Little Bit Counts

Recognition is easy to overlook in remote setups, but it’s vital for motivation. We use Bonus.ly to reward peers for their contributions. Whether it’s debugging an issue or resolving a blocker, a few dollars as a token of appreciation goes a long way.

The monetary value isn’t as important as the gesture itself — it’s about fostering a culture of gratitude and support.

## Conclusion

These are some of the practices we’ve embraced to make remote work thrive at InVision.

Of course, there’s always room for improvement. Each day, we discover new strategies to collaborate more effectively and make our virtual office an incredible place to work. If you have tips or insights, feel free to share them in the discussion area below!
